##__About Me**__

From January to May 2021, I studied Web and Front end development using JavaScript (Angular). During my studies, I learned how to make up websites, including those with adaptive and cross-browser layout.

This area is very interesting to me - it allows me to constantly develop and not stand still.

I easily find common language with people and prefer to work in a team.
